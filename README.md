# Trendy-Baby-Names-
Baby names are  essential for many new parents, so understanding baby name trends and popularity is essential. 
So, which baby names have remained popular for over 100 years, and how do they compare to more recent top baby names? 

I've explored baby name data from the United States Social Security Administration. The data spans 101 years, from 1920 through 2020, and lists first names along with the number and sex of babies they were given to in each year.

The dataset comprises the following: 
* year
* first_name	
* sex	(F/M)
* num: number of babies given  a specific name in a specific year

Goals:
1.  List the overall top five names in alphabetical order and find out if each name is "Classic" or "Trendy
2.  What were the top 20 male names overall?
3.  Which female names appeared in both 1920 and 2020?
